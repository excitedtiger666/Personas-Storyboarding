            It is safe to say that Amazon has revolutionized the
            <em>customer experience</em>. With the advent of amazon prime,
            luxuries such as next-day shipping and convenient return policies
            have become a staple in providing the best customer experience. In
            this project, I explored how Amazon continues to push the boundary
            of consumer satisfaction by expanding its pickup and return policy
            to Amazon Hubs. Customers can now pick up and or return their
            packages at Amazon Hub locations. The pickup and return process is
            made possible by a kiosk machine. This project analyzes the user
            experience of the
            <strong> <u> Amazon hub kiosk interface.</u></strong>

            The kiosk is attempting to make the return and pickup process at the
            Amazon hub simple and fast. Therefore, it makes sense that the kiosk
            has very few components. Its initial loading screen is simple and
            instructs the user to either present their code in the scanner below
            or to touch the screen to enter their code. The barcode can be found
            by visualizing the arrows around the interface. Upon scanning the
            barcode, the locker opens and the user can receive their package.

            To get at the efficacy of the kiosk, I observed users interacting
            with the interface. To limit the interference of my own bias, I
            attempted to get objective observations only. In about 20 minutes,
            the kiosk was used by around 15 people. Here are some observations I
            noted during this time:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 10%">
            <li>
              All users observed received or returned their package in less than
              two minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              No users had trouble locating the interface as identified by a
              smooth gait towards the interface.
            </li>
            <li>Users could fairly easily locate the barcode scanner.</li>
            <li>
              There was some observed trouble with getting the barcode to be
              scanned on the first try.
            </li>
            <li>
              After scanning the barcode, users could easily locate their locker
              - which consisted of their package and or a space to put their
              item. Every user intuitively knew to close the locker despite not
              being prompted by the interface.

            Realizing that observations may be deceitful, I decided to interview
            certain users about their personal experiences interacting with the
            kiosk. The goal of interviewing was to get at the userâ€™s motivation,
            expectations, experience, and challenges using the interface.

            Asking good questions, while may simple, was incredibly difficult.
            Challenges included grappling with using either more open-ended or
            close-ended questions and limiting leading questions and questions
            that are two parts. To make sure I was following good practice, I
            adopted many guidelines from Dillman, which include:
          </p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 10%">
            <li>Ask one question at a time.</li>
            <li>Use simple and familar words.</li>
            <li>Use as few words to pose the question.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Some integral questions that were posed are shown below (in
            parentheses highlights the Dilman guidelines used):

            Why would Amazon be interested in creating hubs where people can
            return or pick up their items? Who did they have in mind while
            designing such an experience and the interface that would be used?
            What edge cases did they account for? These questions are at the
            heart and soul of implementing a human-centered design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section, we will dive into the different personas Amazon may
            have had in mind when creating this interface. Personas are user
            models that are represented as specific, individual human beings
            (Cooper). They are critical in accounting for the diverse array of
            humans that will be utilizing your interface. Again, who did they
            have in mind while designing this interface?

            Human-centered design positions users at the forefront of the
            development process. Effective storyboarding is a great way to
            understand and empathize with the user on a more intimate level and
            thus putting them at the forefront of the design process. Let's
            bring Speedy Sam's persona to life by looking at a storyboard to
            understand his situation better.

            Diving into Sam's story, we get a better understanding of why the
            Amazon Hub Interface would be used in the first place and why it was
            designed the way it was. Here is an incredibly busy user. The use of
            the interface for him is an errand and an extra nuisance to his
            already hectic life. Therefore, the interface must be simple and
            fast to use while ensuring that security is prioritized. Therefore,
            as discussed in the Kiosk section, Amazon's choice to incorporate
            very few components and make the design of the interface simple as
            possible makes complete sense. In the end, the result is a satisfied
            customer who successfully utilized the interface, leading to an 
            easier day in his life- nothing better than that :)
