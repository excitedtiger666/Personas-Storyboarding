          Personas and Storyboarding are two of the most common tools used by UI/UX
          designers to step into users' shoes and understand how they interact with 
          an interface/experience. These tools are simple, effective and inexpensive
          making them an indispensable tool in a designer's arsenal. The following
          article walks through the preparatory steps of creating personas and 
          storyboards including contextual inquiries which involve observing real users interacting
          with an interface and interviewing them about their experiences. I will then
          use this information to develop two personas as well as a storyboard for one 
          of these personas. 
        </p>
        <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>
          Personas are user models that are represented as specific, individual human beings.
          They are not actual people but are synthesized directly from observations of real
          people. One of the key elements that allow personas to be successful as user models
          is that they are personifications. This helps engage the empathy of the designer and
          other stakeholders in a way that simpler user models are unable to.
          (Cooper et al., About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design)
        </p>
        <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
        <p>
          Storyboards are visual representations of a narrative depicting a
          persona using an interface/experience. Narrative is one of our most powerful creative 
          methods. Imagining a story about a person using a product leverages our creativity
          to a greater extent than when we just imagine a better form factor or configuration of
          screen elements. Further, because of the intrinsically social aspect of a narrative, it
          is a very effective and compelling way to share good ideas among team members and stakeholders.

        <h3>Selecting an Interface</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to pick an interface that was in public view (i.e., so that other members
          of the public may see what is going on) so as to not make those being observed feel
          uncomfortable or surprised that someone could see what they were doing. At the same time,
          I did not want to pick something that only had very simple interactive components like 
          a faucet or door handle. So I decided to go with an automated ordering kiosk at a cafe.

              they can scroll down on this page to view more drinks. At the very top of the screen
              there is a search icon they can click which will bring up a keyboard allowing them to
              search for a drink of their choice. They can also tap on any of the submenus (Popular, 
              Express, Fruit, Taro etc.) to bring those drinks to the forefront, and they can also
              scroll across that section horizontally to the right to view more submenus.

            <p>
              This interface could aim to do many things, including, but not limited to: <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Allow people to order more quickly when there is a long line.</li>
                <li>Ease pressure on staff during peak hours.</li>
                <li>Give people time and comfort to pick the drink they want.</li>
                <li>For those who do not want to interact with staff.</li>
                <li>Could be a test for a fully automated front-end of the store to help reduce labor costs.</li>
              </ul>

        <h3>The Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <h4>Observations</h4>
        <p>
          I observed 10 customers using the automated kiosk over the course of an hour. The following are
          my key observations: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>50% of customers knew how to navigate the interface very well.</li>
            <li>70% of customers ordered more than one drink.</li>
            <li>100% of customers customized their drink.</li>
            <li>20% of customers made a mistake when customizing their drink but had no way to edit their 
              order so they simply had to delete that item and customize their drink again. They expressed
              dissapointment and spent time attempting to find a way to edit their order.</li>
            <li>60% of customers had headphones on the entire time they were using the interface and 
              were in the store. They appeared preoccupied and it seemed like they did not want to talk to
              anyone.</li>
            <li>90% of customers showed visible dissapointment at the interface asking them for their 
              phone number and name when they tried to checkout. They expressed further dissapointment
              when they realized they had no way to avoid entering that information.</li>
            <li>10% of customers were frustrated by glitches with the interface.</li>
            <li>30% of customers were surprised at not being offered the choice to get a printed receipt.</li>
            <li>20% of customers took a while to find the credit card machine.</li>
            <li>20% of customers expressed confusion at some of the textual information.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Interviews</h4>
        <h5>Questions</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you think about automated kiosks at restuarants or cafes?</li>
            <li>What do you think about the placement of the automated kiosk?</li>
            <li>What do you think is the purpose of the automated kiosk?</li>
            <li>What did you think of the automated kiosk when you first saw it in this cafe?</li>
            <li>What are your thoughts about the home page (i.e., the page with the drinks and menus)?</li>
            <li>After you get to the home page, where would you go next?</li>
            <li>How did you feel about ordering multiple drinks?</li>
            <li>How did you feel about customizing your drink?</li>
            <li>How did you feel about editing a drink you already added to your cart?</li>
            <li>How did you feel about the checkout process? </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Summary of User Sentiments</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nearly all users felt that the interface was well desgined and was intuitive to use. The 
              large buttons and lack of extraneous information helped greatly. The interface was also smooth
              and the touch screen was responsive.</li>
            <li>Users also expressed that they decided to use the machine for one of the following reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>They felt like it gave them a chance to order at their own pace.</li>
                <li>They wanted to ease pressure on staff that they could see were working 
                  hard to prepare drinks.</li>
                <li>They wanted to avoid interacting with staff or to skip a longer line and
                  order their drink more quickly since they were in a hurry.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Users also expressed frustration with one of the following reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>They made a mistake customizing their drink, they had no way to edit their 
                  order so they simply had to delete that item and customize their drink again.</li>
                <li>They were asked to enter their phone number and name before checking out 
                  and not allowed to avoid entering that information.</li>
                <li>Glitches with the interface like the keyboard not collapsing after concluding
                  a search or being unable to return to the cart to checkout etc.</li>
                <li>The menu was billingual and had some spacing and script related bugs which caused some
                  of the textual information to be confusing.</li>
                <li>The credit card machine was obscured from view and did not provide the option for a 
                  receipt.</li>
                <li>The rewards program awarded the user with stars after ordering but it was unclear
                  how they would use those stars.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

        <p>These personas are based on overarching trends I observed amongst all the users I interviewed, 
          not characteristics I observed from a specific individual. I've created a four-quadrant empathy map,
          describing what users think, feel, say, and do for one archetypal character that will represent part
          of the spectrum of users I observed. </p>

          Izzy is an introvert and likes to avoid unnecessary human interaction when possible. They normally go
          up to the counter but get nervous and feel awkward about wasting the cashier’s time and order the 
          standard drink which they don’t actually enjoy. They are reluctant to ask for help when they are not
          able to figure something out and get flustered very easily. So, they are very happy about being able
          to use an automated kiosk to order instead of doing so at the counter and take their own sweet time 
          while feeling very comfortable.

          Frank is short tempered and not having a good day. Already frustrated, they come to the cafe for a 
          drink to cool off; but every part of the process seems to not work as it should, frustrating them 
          even further. They just want to get out of there as fast as they can but they are not able to. They
          don't read any of the instructions and try to speed through the process while also pressing harder
          than they should on the touchscreen causing glitches. They are unhappy about the bilingual nature
          of the menu and the resulting lack of clarity on certain menu items. The lack of explanation on
          the rewards process and the fact that they are spending so much time on this all contributes to
          an unpleasant experience.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>To summarize this process, I think it's clear that personas and storyboards are powerful 
          tools that help capture the intricaies and nuances of a user experience in a way that simpler
          tools like user roles, market segments etc. simply cannot do. Automation in industries like 
          food are often touted as an unnecessary evil and articles like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-self-checkout-is-and-has-always-been-the-worst-1833106695">this one</a> 
          explain why it could be, as it was for Frustrated Frank, but hopefully Introverted Izzy was
          a good example of why it could be a blessing to some as well.</p>
